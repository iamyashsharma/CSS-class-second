	<br>
	<p>Today our topic is very interesting and exciting because in this we are going to play with fonts.</p>
	<br>
	<p>So, let's get started without wasting our time.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>If you wanna change your text style then you can use this command ("font-family:any font of your choice or whatever you like;")</b></p>
    <br>
    <p id="bull">Example:- Now i will change font of only this line by using ("font-family: cursive;")</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>If you wanna increase boldness of any text/font then use this command ("font-weight: bold;")</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Note:- <b>You can also change boldness by using ("b") tag but in CSS we do not use it because it's not that much professional.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p class="van">Example:- Now i am going to change boldness of this line by using ("font-weight: bold;")</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>If you wanna increase your text/font size then you can use this command ("font-sixe: ;")</b></p>
    <br>
    <p id="mat">Example:- Now, i will change font size of this line by using ("font-size: 70px;")</p>
    <br>
    <p>Note:- <b>Here px (pixel) is the unit of font-size it's also a unit of width,height etc.and 1px = 1/96th of an inch.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>That's it for today i hope so you would have understood it.</p>
